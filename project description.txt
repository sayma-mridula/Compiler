My Compiler Can Do:

1. Module Management:
   - Imports modules with syntax like `#IMPORT <header>`.

2. Class and Function Support:
   - Handles class declarations and functions like `start()`.

3. Variable Handling:
   - Declares and initializes variables with types (`intg`, `float`, `charac`, `long`).
   - Detects duplicate declarations.

4. Control Structures:
   - Supports `if`, `elif`, `else`, `forl`, and `while` loops with nested conditions.

5. Switch-Case Statements:
   - Implements `switchto` with cases and a default (`Builtin`) case.

6. Mathematical and Logical Operations:
   - Performs arithmetic operations (`jog`, `biyog`, `gun`, `vag`) and includes logical operators (`eq`, `neq`, `Gt`, `Lt`).

7. Built-In Functions:
   - Includes utilities like `sin`, `cos`, `log`, `squaroot`, GCD, prime checks, and `ODDEVEN`.

8. Input/Output:
   - Uses `show` for output and `in` for input.

9. Comment Recognition:
   - Detects single-line (`//`) and multi-line (`/* ... */`) comments.

10. Error Handling:
    - Detects undeclared variables, division by zero, and syntax errors.

11. Custom Syntax:
    - Uses `Begin`/`End` for blocks, `;;` for statement terminators, and `::` for cases.

12. Execution Results:
    - Logs outputs of operations, loops, and conditions, ending with "Successful compilation" if error-free.
